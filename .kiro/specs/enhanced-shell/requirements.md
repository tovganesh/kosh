# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing Kosh shell to provide a fully functional command line interface with working Unix command implementations. The enhanced shell will transform the current mock implementation into a production-ready shell that can execute real file system operations, process management commands, and system utilities commonly found in Unix-like systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Unix File System Commands

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to use standard Unix file system commands, so that I can navigate and manipulate files and directories efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type "ls [path]" THEN the shell SHALL display actual directory contents from the file system
2. WHEN I type "cd <directory>" THEN the shell SHALL change the current working directory and update the prompt
3. WHEN I type "pwd" THEN the shell SHALL display the current working directory path
4. WHEN I type "mkdir <directory>" THEN the shell SHALL create a new directory via the file system service
5. WHEN I type "rmdir <directory>" THEN the shell SHALL remove an empty directory via the file system service
6. WHEN I type "rm <file>" THEN the shell SHALL delete the specified file via the file system service
7. WHEN I type "touch <file>" THEN the shell SHALL create an empty file or update timestamps via the file system service
8. WHEN I type "cat <file>" THEN the shell SHALL display the actual file contents from the file system

### Requirement 2: Process Management Commands

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor and manage processes, so that I can understand system state and control running applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type "ps" THEN the shell SHALL display actual running processes with PID, name, and status
2. WHEN I type "ps -a" THEN the shell SHALL display all processes including system processes
3. WHEN I type "kill <pid>" THEN the shell SHALL send a termination signal to the specified process
4. WHEN I type "killall <name>" THEN the shell SHALL terminate all processes with the specified name
5. WHEN I type "jobs" THEN the shell SHALL display background jobs started from this shell session

### Requirement 3: System Information Commands

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to access system information, so that I can monitor system resources and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type "uname" THEN the shell SHALL display system information (OS name, version, architecture)
2. WHEN I type "uptime" THEN the shell SHALL display system uptime and load information
3. WHEN I type "free" THEN the shell SHALL display memory usage statistics
4. WHEN I type "df" THEN the shell SHALL display file system disk usage
5. WHEN I type "mount" THEN the shell SHALL display mounted file systems

### Requirement 4: Text Processing and Utilities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic text processing commands, so that I can manipulate and analyze text files efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type "echo <text>" THEN the shell SHALL output the specified text with variable expansion
2. WHEN I type "grep <pattern> <file>" THEN the shell SHALL search for the pattern in the file and display matches
3. WHEN I type "head <file>" THEN the shell SHALL display the first 10 lines of the file
4. WHEN I type "tail <file>" THEN the shell SHALL display the last 10 lines of the file
5. WHEN I type "wc <file>" THEN the shell SHALL display word, line, and character counts for the file

### Requirement 5: Command Line Features

**User Story:** As a shell user, I want advanced command line features, so that I can work efficiently with complex commands and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press Tab THEN the shell SHALL provide command and filename completion
2. WHEN I press Up/Down arrows THEN the shell SHALL navigate through command history
3. WHEN I type "command1 | command2" THEN the shell SHALL pipe output from command1 to command2
4. WHEN I type "command > file" THEN the shell SHALL redirect command output to a file
5. WHEN I type "command &" THEN the shell SHALL run the command in the background
6. WHEN I type "command1 && command2" THEN the shell SHALL execute command2 only if command1 succeeds
7. WHEN I set environment variables THEN they SHALL be available to child processes

### Requirement 6: Driver and System Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage drivers and system services, so that I can maintain system functionality and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type "lsmod" THEN the shell SHALL display loaded kernel modules/drivers
2. WHEN I type "dmesg" THEN the shell SHALL display kernel log messages
3. WHEN I type "service <name> status" THEN the shell SHALL show the status of the specified service
4. WHEN I type "service <name> start/stop" THEN the shell SHALL start or stop the specified service
5. WHEN I type "lsdev" THEN the shell SHALL list available hardware devices

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a shell user, I want clear error messages and robust error handling, so that I can understand and recover from command failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command fails THEN the shell SHALL display a clear error message with the reason
2. WHEN I type an invalid command THEN the shell SHALL suggest similar valid commands
3. WHEN a file operation fails THEN the shell SHALL display the specific error (permission denied, file not found, etc.)
4. WHEN system resources are unavailable THEN the shell SHALL handle gracefully and inform the user
5. WHEN the shell encounters an internal error THEN it SHALL recover without crashing

### Requirement 8: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a shell user, I want fast command execution and responsive interaction, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type a command THEN it SHALL execute within 100ms for simple operations
2. WHEN displaying large directory listings THEN the shell SHALL paginate output automatically
3. WHEN reading large files THEN the shell SHALL stream content efficiently without blocking
4. WHEN multiple commands run concurrently THEN the shell SHALL remain responsive for new input
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN essential shell functions SHALL remain available
