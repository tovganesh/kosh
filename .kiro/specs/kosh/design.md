# Kosh Operating System Design Document

## Overview

Kosh is a lightweight, mobile-optimized operating system built with Rust, featuring a microkernel architecture. The design prioritizes security, performance, and resource efficiency while maintaining modularity through clear separation between kernel, user, and driver spaces. The initial implementation targets x86-64 platforms with provisions for ARM64 support.

The microkernel approach minimizes the kernel's responsibilities to essential services (memory management, scheduling, IPC), while moving device drivers, file systems, and other services to user space. This design enhances system stability, security, and maintainability.

### Memory Layout

The system uses a three-tier memory protection model:

- **Kernel Space (Ring 0)**: Contains only the microkernel core
- **Driver Space (Ring 1)**: Isolated space for device drivers with limited hardware access
- **User Space (Ring 3)**: Applications and system services with no direct hardware access

### Boot Architecture

```

## Components and Interfaces

### Microkernel Core

The microkernel provides minimal essential services:

**Memory Manager**
- Virtual memory management with paging
- Physical memory allocation
- Swap space management
- Memory protection between spaces

**Scheduler**
- Preemptive multitasking
- Priority-based scheduling with mobile optimizations
- Power-aware scheduling for battery efficiency
- Real-time scheduling support for interactive tasks

**IPC Manager**
- Message passing between processes
- Synchronous and asynchronous communication
- Capability-based security model
- Shared memory regions for high-performance IPC

### Driver Framework

**Driver Interface**
```rust
trait KoshDriver {
    fn init(&mut self) -> Result<(), DriverError>;
    fn handle_request(&mut self, request: DriverRequest) -> DriverResponse;
    fn cleanup(&mut self);
    fn get_capabilities(&self) -> DriverCapabilities;
}
```

**Driver Manager**
- Dynamic driver loading and unloading
- Driver dependency resolution
- Hardware detection and driver matching
- Driver isolation and fault recovery

### System Services

**File System Service**
- VFS (Virtual File System) layer
- Support for ext4 as primary file system
- Mount point management
- File permissions and metadata

**Memory Service**
- Heap allocation for user processes
- Memory mapping services
- Swap file/partition management
- Memory statistics and monitoring

### Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL)

**Hardware Abstraction**
```rust
trait PlatformInterface {
    fn get_cpu_info(&self) -> CpuInfo;
    fn setup_interrupts(&mut self);
    fn enable_mmu(&mut self, page_table: &PageTable);
    fn get_memory_map(&self) -> MemoryMap;
}
```

**Architecture Support**
- x86-64 implementation with UEFI boot support
- ARM64 interface definitions for future implementation
- Cross-compilation support through Rust's target system

## Data Models

### Process Management

```rust
struct Process {
    pid: ProcessId,
    state: ProcessState,
    memory_space: VirtualAddressSpace,
    capabilities: CapabilitySet,
    priority: Priority,
    cpu_time: Duration,
}

enum ProcessState {
    Running,
    Ready,
    Blocked(BlockReason),
    Zombie,
}
```

### Memory Management

```rust
struct VirtualAddressSpace {
    page_table: PageTable,
    heap_regions: Vec<HeapRegion>,
    stack_regions: Vec<StackRegion>,
    mapped_files: Vec<MappedFile>,
}

struct SwapManager {
    swap_devices: Vec<SwapDevice>,
    swap_cache: LruCache<PageFrame>,
    swap_algorithm: SwapAlgorithm,
}

```rust
struct Message {
    sender: ProcessId,
    receiver: ProcessId,
    message_type: MessageType,
    data: MessageData,
    capabilities: Vec<Capability>,
}

enum MessageType {
    SystemCall,
    DriverRequest,
    ServiceRequest,
    Signal,
}
```

## Error Handling

### Kernel Error Handling

- Core dump generation for debugging
- Resource cleanup on process termination

## Testing Strategy
