# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building Kosh, a lightweight, mobile-optimized operating system written in Rust. The OS will feature a microkernel architecture designed primarily for mobile devices but initially targeting x86 platforms with provisions for ARM support. The system emphasizes performance, security, and resource efficiency while maintaining a clean separation between kernel, user, and driver spaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Microkernel Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a microkernel-based OS design, so that the system is modular, secure, and maintainable with clear separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system boots THEN the kernel SHALL operate in a separate memory space from user applications
2. WHEN drivers are loaded THEN they SHALL run in isolated driver space separate from kernel space
3. WHEN user applications execute THEN they SHALL run in user space with restricted privileges
4. IF a driver crashes THEN the kernel SHALL remain stable and operational
5. WHEN inter-process communication occurs THEN it SHALL use message passing between spaces

### Requirement 2: Platform Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OS to support both x86 and ARM architectures, so that it can run on various hardware platforms including mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OS is compiled for x86 THEN it SHALL boot and run on x86-64 hardware
2. WHEN ARM support is implemented THEN the OS SHALL compile and run on ARM64 platforms
3. WHEN platform-specific code is needed THEN it SHALL be abstracted through hardware abstraction layers
4. IF the target architecture changes THEN the core OS functionality SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN building for different platforms THEN the build system SHALL support cross-compilation

### Requirement 3: Memory Management with Swap Support

**User Story:** As a system user, I want efficient memory management with swap space support, so that the system can handle memory-intensive applications even on resource-constrained devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN physical memory is low THEN the system SHALL move inactive pages to swap space
2. WHEN swapped pages are accessed THEN they SHALL be loaded back into physical memory
3. WHEN swap space is configured THEN it SHALL support both file-based and partition-based swap
4. IF memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to free memory through swapping before failing
5. WHEN memory is allocated THEN it SHALL use virtual memory management with page tables

### Requirement 4: File System Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want a reliable open-source file system, so that I can store and access files efficiently with data integrity guarantees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OS boots THEN it SHALL support at least one open-source file system (ext4 or similar)
2. WHEN files are created THEN they SHALL be stored with proper metadata and permissions
3. WHEN file operations occur THEN they SHALL support standard POSIX-like operations (read, write, create, delete)
4. IF file system corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms
5. WHEN multiple file systems are mounted THEN they SHALL be accessible through a unified namespace

### Requirement 5: Rust Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OS written in Rust, so that it benefits from memory safety, performance, and modern language features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the kernel is compiled THEN it SHALL be written entirely in Rust with minimal unsafe code
2. WHEN memory operations occur THEN Rust's ownership system SHALL prevent memory leaks and buffer overflows
3. WHEN system calls are implemented THEN they SHALL use Rust's type system for safety
4. IF unsafe code is required THEN it SHALL be clearly documented and minimized
5. WHEN building the OS THEN it SHALL use Rust's package manager (Cargo) for dependency management

### Requirement 6: Mobile Optimization

**User Story:** As a mobile device user, I want an OS optimized for mobile use cases, so that it provides efficient power management and responsive user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is idle THEN the OS SHALL implement power-saving features
2. WHEN applications run THEN the scheduler SHALL prioritize interactive tasks for responsiveness
3. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the OS SHALL efficiently manage CPU, memory, and I/O
4. IF battery level is low THEN the system SHALL reduce background activity
5. WHEN touch input occurs THEN the system SHALL respond with minimal latency

### Requirement 7: Driver Framework

**User Story:** As a hardware vendor, I want a clean driver interface, so that I can develop drivers that integrate seamlessly with the OS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN drivers are loaded THEN they SHALL run in isolated driver space
2. WHEN drivers communicate with hardware THEN they SHALL use standardized interfaces
3. WHEN driver errors occur THEN they SHALL not crash the kernel
4. IF a driver needs kernel services THEN it SHALL use well-defined system calls
5. WHEN new hardware is detected THEN the system SHALL support dynamic driver loading

### Requirement 8: Boot and Initialization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a fast and reliable boot process, so that the system starts quickly and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system powers on THEN it SHALL boot using a standard bootloader (UEFI/BIOS)
2. WHEN kernel initialization occurs THEN it SHALL set up memory management, scheduling, and core services
3. WHEN drivers are initialized THEN they SHALL be loaded in the correct dependency order
4. IF boot fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
5. WHEN the boot process completes THEN user space SHALL be ready to run applications

### Requirement 9: ISO Image Creation and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create bootable ISO images and test them in VirtualBox, so that I can develop and validate the OS in a controlled virtual environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process completes THEN it SHALL generate a bootable ISO image
2. WHEN the ISO is created THEN it SHALL include the kernel, bootloader, and essential system files
3. WHEN the ISO is loaded in VirtualBox THEN it SHALL boot successfully
4. WHEN testing in VirtualBox THEN all core OS functionality SHALL work correctly
5. IF the ISO fails to boot THEN the build system SHALL provide clear error messages
