# Simple Boot Test

The error "no multiboot loader found, error: you need to load the kernel first" suggests that GRUB cannot find a valid multiboot2 header in the kernel binary.

Let me create a simple test to verify the multiboot2 header is working correctly.

## Current Status

The kernel builds successfully, but GRUB cannot recognize it as a multiboot2-compliant kernel.

## Next Steps

1. Create a minimal multiboot2 header that GRUB can recognize
2. Test the header validation
3. Once the header works, we can add back the platform abstraction layer

## Testing the Current ISO

Even though the multiboot2 header isn't being recognized by grub-file, let's try booting the current ISO in VirtualBox to see what happens. Sometimes the ISO will still boot even if the validation tool doesn't recognize it.
